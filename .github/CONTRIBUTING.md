# Contributing
Before contributing to this repository, please reach out to Cole via email, slack, or DM to get tied in with the development channel and the jira board.

## Pull-Request Process
1. First, get assigned a story from the Jira board.
2. Make a local branch using the ticket identifier as the branch name (WOOG-###)
3. If working on a non-story fix or feature, label your branch as fix/describe_my_fix or feature/describe_my_feature.
4. Carry out local development, making sure to write test cases and manually test your code as you proceed.
5. Push your changes up to the remote story branch.
6. Once you've completed the story, open a Pull Request to pull the branch into develop, making sure to fill out the required information.
7. After your code is reviewed and accepted, squash and merge your commits into develop. Then, they will be built and delpoyed.
