### The REST API Powering the Wooglin Slackbot.

This REST API handles the base functionality for features executed by the Wooglin Slackbot. It provides methods by which the bot is able to interact with the chapter data. 

The API itself is written using Django, and will be deployed using Docker and Heroku. The API is documented using OpenAPI's Swagger UI. Which can be accessed at http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/swagger, when working on a development environment locally.
